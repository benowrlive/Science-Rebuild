/* <fp-predict data-question="What happens when it warms up?"

   The pedagogical core of the product, and the smallest component in it.

   Sinha & Kapur's meta-analysis found that the single highest-value feature of
   problem-solving-first instruction is instruction that visibly BUILDS ON the
   learner's own generated solution (g = 0.56). Here that is implemented as
   string interpolation: the child commits to a prediction, and when the
   simulation resolves, echo() renders their own words next to the result.

   It pays XP for making a prediction, NOT for being right (blueprint 7.1).
   Rewarding only correct predictions teaches children to guess safe, which
   destroys the mechanism the simulation depends on. */
