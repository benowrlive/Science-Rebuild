/* Spaced retrieval. Blueprint 7.3 — the engine, not a feature.

   Retrieval practice and spacing are the two best-evidenced interventions in
   the learning sciences, they benefit children as young as infancy, and
   corrective feedback amplifies them. A single end-of-lesson quiz is the weak
   form of this; the effect lives in re-testing across days.

   SM-2-lite: a fixed interval ladder with a per-concept ease multiplier. Full
   SM-2 tunes ease from a six-point self-rated difficulty scale, which a
   seven-year-old cannot supply honestly. Three grades derived from observed
   performance is what we can actually measure.
   ponytail: fixed ladder, not a fitted forgetting curve — revisit if review
   accuracy data ever says the ladder is wrong. */
