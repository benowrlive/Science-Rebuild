/* <fp-folding> — why a string of beads becomes one particular shape.

   THE IDEA. A protein is made as a floppy chain and ends up as a precise
   machine, and nothing folds it. There is no mould and no instructions for the
   shape — the shape is a CONSEQUENCE of the sequence, arrived at by the chain
   falling into its lowest-energy arrangement. Which is why the same sequence
   always gives the same shape, in a cell or in a test tube, and why changing
   one bead can wreck it.

   THE MODEL. This is the HP lattice model — Dill, 1985 — and it is a real one
   that real papers use, not a cartoon invented for children. Every residue is
   just oily (H) or water-loving (P), the chain lives on a square grid, and the
   only energy term is: two oily residues touching on the grid, without being
   neighbours in the chain, is worth -1. That single rule reproduces the thing
   that matters — a hydrophobic core forming on the inside with the polar
   residues left facing out — from nothing but "oil avoids water".

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES OUT. Real folding has hydrogen bonding, backbone
   geometry, side-chain packing and three dimensions. None of them is the reason
   a protein folds at all; the hydrophobic effect is. Modelling one cause well
   is honest. Modelling five badly would look more impressive and teach less.

   THE MOVE is a pivot: tap a residue and everything after it swings ninety
   degrees. That is the standard Monte Carlo move for lattice proteins. An
   earlier version of this comment claimed four taps always return you to where
   you started and that every arrangement is reachable; a test caught both as
   false. Self-avoidance refuses some pivots, which breaks the first, and pivot
   moves are not provably ergodic on a lattice, which breaks the second. What is
   true, and is what the child actually needs, is that **a refused move changes
   nothing at all** — the chain is never left half-moved — and that the refusal
   is shown, because "that one is blocked" is a fact about the shape.

   The buttons ARE the interaction rather than a keyboard fallback for it, so
   the accessible path and the primary path are the same path. */
