/* <fp-selection> — natural selection with its three conditions on switches.

   THE THING THIS EXISTS TO TEACH. Natural selection is not a force and not a
   preference. It is what happens automatically, with nobody arranging it, when
   three plain facts about a population are all true at once:

     1. VARIATION      — the individuals are not identical.
     2. HEREDITY       — offspring resemble their parents.
     3. DIFFERENTIAL   — the differences change who survives.
        SURVIVAL

   Every one of those is a fact you can check by looking, not a claim about the
   distant past. And the reason they are on switches rather than in a paragraph
   is that the interesting result is a NEGATIVE one: turn any single condition
   off and adaptation stops dead, while the other two carry on doing exactly
   what they were doing. A child who has watched the line go flat three
   different ways owns the mechanism in a way no definition delivers.

   THE HONESTY. Nothing here is scripted. There is no term anywhere in this file
   that pushes the population towards the background. Each beetle takes its own
   survival roll; the survivors breed; the mean shade moves because of who is
   left, never because anything moved it. If the file contained a "drift toward
   bg" line the whole demonstration would be a puppet show, and the flat lines
   under a switched-off condition are the proof that it does not.

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL. Differential FERTILITY — some
   individuals leaving more offspring — is a second route to the same result,
   and survivors here all breed equally so that survival is the only channel
   under test. Naming a mechanism you have isolated is honest; quietly modelling
   two and calling it one is not.

   EPISODIC, not continuous. A generation happens when the child asks for it.
   The shared 60Hz loop only reveals the result, which is why this sim needs no
   reduced-motion substitution: with the reveal removed the mechanism is
   untouched, and both motion modes drive the identical two-beat control. */

   condition off also changed how many died, a child could not tell which of the
   two changes made the adaptation stop. */
