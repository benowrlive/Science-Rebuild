/* <fp-spike> — why a nerve signal is the same size however hard you poke it.

   THE IDEA. A nerve does not send a bigger signal for a bigger stimulus. It
   sends the SAME signal, or none. Below a threshold nothing happens at all;
   above it you get a full spike, and doubling the stimulus does not make the
   spike bigger. That is the all-or-nothing law, and it is the single most
   counter-intuitive fact about nerves: strength is not carried by size.

   THE MODEL is FitzHugh–Nagumo, a real reduced model that appears in the
   computational neuroscience literature, not a cartoon:

       dv/dt = v − v³/3 − w + I
       dw/dt = ε(v + a − bw)

   Two variables — a fast one that spikes and a slow one that recovers — and
   from those five terms you get a genuine threshold, a genuine spike shape,
   and a genuine refractory period during which a second stimulus does nothing.
   None of that is scripted; it falls out of the equations.

   WHAT IT GETS WRONG, MEASURED. I checked the f–I curve before authoring any
   goals: firing rate runs from 0.31 Hz just above threshold to 0.41 Hz at its
   fastest. A real neuron spans two orders of magnitude, so this model badly
   compresses rate coding, and the lessons therefore do NOT teach a rate curve
   from it. What it does show correctly, and what is taught: the sharp
   threshold, near-constant amplitude (peak 1.75 against 1.81 for a stimulus
   67% stronger), and the fact that firing STOPS again above about I = 1.4.
   That last one is not an artefact — it is depolarisation block, which is why
   very high extracellular potassium silences a heart and why some anaesthetics
   work. Teaching the window rather than the curve is the honest use of it.

   INTEGRATION. Euler at a substep of 0.02 model units, several per frame, so
   the cubic stays stable while model time runs fast enough to watch. */
