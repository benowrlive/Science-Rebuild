/* <fp-sim> — the base every simulation extends. Blueprint 8.2, 10, 11.3, 13.

   Four contracts, and a simulation that breaks any of them is not finished:

   1. ONE LOOP. Every running sim is stepped by a single requestAnimationFrame,
      not one each. Ten sims on a page must cost one frame's overhead, not ten.
      The loop pauses when the document is hidden and each sim pauses when it
      scrolls out of view.

   2. IT MUST DESCRIBE ITSELF. describe() returns a sentence about the current
      state, written into a live region. A simulation that cannot narrate itself
      is unusable without sight, and retrofitting that at lesson forty is
      ruinous — so the base class throws if a subclass has not implemented it.

   3. CAUSAL MOTION IS SUBSTITUTED, NOT REMOVED. Under prefers-reduced-motion
      the loop does not drive this sim; a step control does. The child still
      reaches every state of the mechanism, under their own control, with no
      involuntary motion. `animation: none` would delete the lesson.

   4. FIXED TIMESTEP. step() always receives the same dt, so the physics is
      identical on a 60Hz laptop, a 120Hz tablet and a step-through click.
      A dt that varies with frame rate makes a simulation teach different
      things to different children.

   5. THE MODEL IS NOT THE ANIMATION. A sim may be continuous (molecules, which
      genuinely tick) or EPISODIC (generations, heartbeats, outbreaks — which
      advance when a child asks). An episodic sim sets `autoplay` false, computes
      its new state in one go, and uses the loop only to reveal it. That is what
      makes it reduced-motion-native: with the reveal removed, the mechanism is
      untouched. Contract 3 still applies to what the reveal shows. */
