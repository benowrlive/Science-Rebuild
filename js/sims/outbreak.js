/* <fp-outbreak> — why a few percent of coverage decides whether an epidemic happens.

   THE MODEL is SIR — susceptible, infectious, recovered — which is the standard
   compartmental model of an epidemic and about as old as mathematical
   epidemiology itself:

       dS/dt = −βSI/N
       dI/dt =  βSI/N − γI
       dR/dt =  γI

   R₀ = β/γ is the average number of people one infectious person infects in a
   fully susceptible population. Nothing about the threshold is put in by hand:
   it emerges because dI/dt is positive only while βS/N > γ, which stops being
   true once enough of the population is immune.

   MEASURED BEFORE ANY LESSON WAS WRITTEN AGAINST IT, per 1,000 people:

     R₀ = 3, no vaccination     941 ever infected, peak 302 at day 54
     R₀ = 3, 50% vaccinated     261 ever infected, peak 32
     R₀ = 3, 67% vaccinated      13 ever infected — the outbreak dies
     R₀ = 15, 90% vaccinated     58 ever infected
     R₀ = 15, 93% vaccinated     12 ever infected

   Those last two are the reason this simulation exists. Measles has a threshold
   of about 93%, and the difference between 90% and 93% coverage is the
   difference between an outbreak and no outbreak. It is not a gradual trade —
   it is a threshold, and it is why measles returns to places where coverage
   slipped by a few points and nothing else changed. */
