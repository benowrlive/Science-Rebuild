/* Sprout — the learning companion. Blueprint 9.

   Rule-based, offline, deterministic, zero cost, no backend, no data leaves the
   device. Behind one async interface so a live model can be substituted later
   without touching a call site.

   IT NEVER GIVES ANSWERS until the last rung. The ladder escalates only on real
   struggle, and rungs 0-2 are the whole product for most children:

     0 notice      "Something changed when you did that. Did you see what?"
     1 focus       "Watch just the blue ones this time."
     2 compare     "Those got through. Those didn't. What's different?"
     3 analogy     "A door that only lets some people through — where else?"
     4 partial     "Size matters here. What else might?"
     5 consolidate names the concept, then immediately asks them to apply it

   Only rung 5 states a fact, and it is reached only after genuine struggle.

   Lessons may author their own ladder per stage. Where they have not, the
   generic ladder below is used — written per stage TYPE, so the tutor is useful
   from the first lesson rather than waiting for 125 lessons to be annotated.
   ponytail: generic ladders, not per-stage authoring, until a real child shows
   the generic ones falling short. */
